Put on a cookie cooling rack before putting in oven to get in and out easily by using a potholder to grab the cooling rack with pizza on it"

I haven't seen them in a while so I hope they are not discontinued :( these are some of the best frozen barbecue pizza I've ever tasted ! Definitely recommend giving them a try. I will say they are a little small and thin . I can easy eat one on my own"
